### Checking Normality and equality of variance of variableslibrary(ggpubr)library(dplyr)## import your table of variable values.x<-read.table("filename.txt", header=T)## Check data using a QQplot to see if actual data points lie along a simulated ## line of the normal distributionggqqplot(x$V1) ### Use the V orefix to indicate which column you mean or its name if you named it.## Check density plot of dataggdensity(x$V1)## Alongside these visual methods, use a Shapiro Wilks testshapiro.test(x$V1)## If p value is greater than 0.05, you can assume normality of data. Is less, it is not normally distributed.### Equality of variance with F test.## You want to compare at least two variables and ensure they have equivalent variance.## Combine your variables into a single csv file.  The csv allows you to hav variables of different lengths.## Import the csvx<-read.csv("filename", header=T)res.ftest <- var.test(Badger ~ Bovine, data = x)## The Ftest can be very sensitive to minor departures from normality
